In other words, we're looking for somebody who can take our customer service, inventory tracking, route planning, and other systems to the next level.

Right now, we're using Zoho CRM, our own MySQL database, Quickbooks Online, Recurly/Intuit to process payments, Tropo to send SMS, MailChimp for email, Joomla for our web front-end, and are evaluating a few options for route planning and inventory control.<br>\n<br>\nOnce you're selected, we'd develop a prioritized roadmap of all our web application to-dos.

The premise was a Dad-centric site, based on Event Planning/Scheduling (think hybrid of Evite + FB + Meetup.com) but more. The many desired functions hinge on, and are limited to, a strict site focus for Dads.  Moms heavily outdo Dads in this arena.  I had many responses and chose one.  The site progressed in the Spring, but due to issues out of my control, the work slowed and recently stopped.<br>\n<br>\n<b><u>PROJECT NOW</u></b><br>\nI speak to you as the <b><i>President of DadsPlan, LLC</i></b>, the latest and last incarnation of this idea.  DadsPlan.com is not launched, but there is a back-end and framework built around of myriad of cool and complex ideas. The site thus far is built in php and uses Joomla.  The code is being packaged to be sent to whoever will accept this offer.  Obviously I would like an expert in php/Joomla, as I want to avoid recreating the wheel. I've been told there is functionality I have not seen, but will be documented with the packaging.  My hope is find someone who can take off running where this was left off.  If some of my ideas can not be implemented using php/Joomla, I'm not married to them, and will discuss as plan moving forward.<br>\n<br>\n<b><u>REQUIREMENTS</u></b><br>\n<ol>- php/Joomla:    or other languages/packages if php/Joomla not practical to finish<br>\n- SEO/SEM         <br>\n- Experience /w Monetized Sites (Shopping Carts, PayPal,, Adsense, Direct Affiliate Links, Donations)<br>\n- Event Calendars/Scheduling Calendars.  (Current Calendar in JEVENT)<br>\n- Aestethic Eye:  Comfortable with front and back-end programming.  I have functions to be implemented and an idea of how to present them all (in a dash board style) .<br>\n- Act as Primary: Only to deal with one person. Ex: If graphics or potential App Dev needs to be farmed out, it's on you to find and coordinate.  I'll trust and pay you.<br>\n- Time and Good Communications.  My prior independent programmer became over-extended, and not quick to give status updates or show incremental achievements.<br>\n- Creativity: Seamlessly integrate form and function, and offer ideas to me.  I'm not a control freak, or a genius, I just want it clean and working.<br>\n- <u>Enthusiasm</u>: <blockquote>I'm not building a boring blog, a corporate page, or some faceless shopping site.  Though it needs to be monetized, this is personal to me, because it is an extension of my life as a married Dad of two.  I've seen what's out there, and it's very bloggish/news aggregation.  NYC has a growing Dads Meetup, but it still pales in functionally to what I have in mind. I consider this a  Social Utility for Dads, and I wouldn't continue if I felt I was offering the same old thing.  I have enough cool/unique ideas, and pending business relationships to tap - I just need the tech. </blockquote> </ol><br>\n<b><u>PAY</u></b><br>\nNegotiable. I'm open. I ask all applicants to state your usual rates to me, and provide links to work you've done.  Until someone looks at the existing code, it not clear how many hours may be needed to get to a launch status - which may effect the rate.<br>\n<br>\n<b><u>BUSINESS OP?</u></b><br>\nIn my Feb 2011 posting I offered the idea of an official partnership. As an LLC I can accommodate as such if it means more personal investment on your part for a share of profits - we can talk and make formal arrangements.  But for now, I'm assuming to hire as a contractor and just see what goes from there. Again, I'm open.  And once the site is running, I will probably require ongoing tech.<br>\n<br>\n<b><u>TIMEFRAME</u></b><br>\nLaunchable by end of Fall. There's a lot of ideas (I maintain a sharable Google Doc for this). Maybe not all need to be in place for an initial launch.  Was aiming for the Summer, so I'm already behind.    <br>\n<br>\n<b><u>WHAT EXISTS NOW?</u></b><br>\nRead the <b>INTRO</b> at <a href=\"http://www.DadsPlan.com/home\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.DadsPlan.com/home</a> and you'll get a feel of WHAT's there and WHY it's there..  The programmer set up a basic page to show the Intro...then added the start of a JEVENT Calendar.  We had problems Mirroring some functions from his home server to DreamHost, so we had to stop here.  I already redesigned in Photoshop a dashboard look for a homepage, so we would work off that.<br>\n<br>\n<b><u>LESSONS LEARNED</u></b><br>\nFrom my last posting, so many people responded, many with very nice work.  Now that I have a better idea of the final product I can more adequately compare submitted work to my vision for a match.  Even with that, I imagine many qualified applicants...so I will implore you to state in your email, if applicable, why you could not only program the site, but offer any personal experience that could be used to better my own ideas.  My specific ideas and my direct email will be shared with those who apply.<br>\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br>\n<br>\nI know this Site can succeed with the right person coding.  I also have Social Media specialists waiting in the wings to increase visibility when ready - unless you are that person also.   <br>\nI look forward to hearing from you!<br>\n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br>\n<br>","url":"http://hudsonvalley.craigslist.org/web/2590021740.html","title":"NEW SITE LAUNCH: WebMaster/Site Admin/Content Manager"},{"email":"gigs-zazvw-2590020946@craigslist.org","posted_on":"2011/09/09 09:27:00 -0700","body":"We are female clothing company that could be described as Nasty Gal meets Forever21.<br>\n<br>\nCurrently we are redesigning our site and need someone with a great eye for design to take our site design to the next level, preferable someone who has worked on fashion websites before.

The main issue is that I'm not a designer, so it takes me a lot longer than it should to setup a pretty template. <br>\n<br>\nI can't pay for this, but you get to be part of a great campaign and, if we're successful, you can be a member of the presidential staff. Note that we have not yet researched the legal status of robot politicians. This should be a fun project and can be used satirically as you see fit- as long as the character remains constant you can weave in whatever writing you'd like.","url":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/nby/cpg/2589525421.html","title":"Help get a robot elected president"},{"email":"gigs-8znfr-2589523100@craigslist.org","posted_on":"2011/09/09 00:10:00 -0700","body":"Looking to hire 3-5 remote support technicians.<br>\nFlexible hours, full or part-time.<br>\nMust be motivated, and have good computer skills.<br>\n<br>\nPreferred Skills:<br>\nKnow how to remove viruses.<br>\nGeneral Microsoft Office skills.<br>\nEmail setups.<br>\nPrinter setups.<br>\nDriver installs.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThere will be a week of paid training (we will teach you all skills you need)<br>","url":"http://portland.craigslist.org/mlt/cpg/2589523100.html","title":"Remote Tech Support"},{"email":"gigs-jnjnp-2589517266@craigslist.org","posted_on":"2011/09/08 23:52:00 -0700","body":"I am not sure what I press on the remote.

For example, web developers should have the ability to replicate features often found in a CRUD environment such as a cms.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Company Description:</b><br>\nWe are a development agency located downtown Montreal (near Metro Place des Arts and Metro McGill). The company primarily provides web development as a service.<br>\n<br>\nOur work policies are pretty lax as we tend to focus more on results than on processes. We don't intend to watch your every moves and would like to respect your time and space. This works by us entrusting you with responsibilities and relying on your best judgment to achieve a certain amount of tasks. In other words, you get to enjoy enough freedom and flexibility to decide how and where you work best.<br>\n<br>\nIn order for us to reach that level of trust, we need to work with honest people, with a level of minutiae, dedication and passion for their craft.<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>FAQs:</b><br>\n<ul><br>\n<li>Does that mean I can work from home?<br>\n<br>\nLike the ad says, you do what works best for your productivity at any given time.

You're certainly not obliged to be at the office all the time, but keep in mind that part of being in a team involves some social responsibilities.<br>\n<br>\nAlso, there will be times during which some knowledge transfer will be necessary. It's usually better to be in-house.<br>\n<br>\n<li>I don't live in Montreal, can I apply?<br>\n<br>\nYou will need to have compelling qualities to compensate for the distance. Our collaboration might also initially be on a contractual basis.<br>\n<br>\n<li>I have experience programming in C/C++/Java, can I apply?<br>\n<br>\nYou probably are pretty skilled with those languages, but at this moment we have very little use for them and really need people that can be up and running in PHP or Python from day 1.<br>\n</ul><br>\n<br>\n<b>Other considerations:</b><br>\nIf you've read this post all the way down here, it means that you somewhat paid attention to <u>our</u> need and didn't just stop after the first paragraph to pitch us your cv.

This is the first piece in what will become a much larger site with many more features.

Developer will need to create a database to manage the service providers' information pages.<br>\n<br>\n2) Users will search for these service providers from a homepage and have those service providers appear in search results, ranked by relevance.

This is an outside sales position and you can work from home or your virtual office. You will report directly to the owner of the company. </p>\n<p> From past experience, we have found that sales representatives with SOME experience tend to find website-related sales relatively easy compared to other industries because people and companies need websites and online services.

Typically, <b>a person with approximately 1-5 years of sales experience tends to be most suitable for this opportunity</b>.</p>\n<p>The responsibilities and requirements below represent an ideal candidate in our minds.

Once this document clearly explains what needs to be built, it will be posted on a software outsourcing website for the actual development phase of this project.<br>\n<br>\nAt this point we have an interactive HTML demo (customer facing, no admin/backend screens) built in Axure RP that can be used as a guide to explain how each product should be displayed to the customer. The problem is that it does not show the dynamic lookups and correlations that need to take place behind the scenes to populate each drop down menu. It further doesn't show session state (?) and/or what options a customer has selected in previous steps. Without this explanation the demo is relatively worthless - this is what will need to be determined first and then written up correctly in the requirements document.<br>\n<br>\nThere are additional requirements that we can explain as to how the plugin should function such as plugin installation, product/properties/menu/display setup, XML import/export, and shortcode embedding within a Wordpress page/post.<br>\n<br>\nRequirements:<br>\n<br>\nYou *MUST* have strong experience with developing Wordpress plugins as there are ways in which the Wordpress platform can be leveraged to manage the plugin on the backend. Additional features will also be highly likely in the future, therefore version 1.0 needs to be spec'd out properly with this in mind.<br>\n<br>\nYou *MUST* be local to the Central Ohio area for in-person meetings so that we can give you an overview of the demo and explain how various products, data, and functions relate to each other - then have you outline and write out a spec that a developer can then work from independently.<br>\n<br>\nThe final deliverable will be a document that can be uploaded/attached to an online project posting.

We are a small growing business, but still small. <br>\n<br>\nRead the information here and please advise if you are interested. <br>\n <br>\nBackground: We have a small firm that provides contracted services to the legal industry using independent contractors.  We bill our clients and pay our contractors fees based upon the amount charged, and keep a portion for ourselves. We utilize a vertical software package leased from and remotely supported by the developer.  The software includes modules for scheduling and billing, and contractor payments  modules, as well as a web module that allows our clients the ability (via the web) to schedule as well as access documents prepared for them by us. The software includes both server and workstation components, which we currently run on the same machine under XP with SQL Server Express 2008.  We run a peer-to-peer network; router is CISCO WRVS4400N. We have 5 static IP addresses.<br>\n <br>\nOur intentions are:<br>\n1. To move from a peer-to-peer network, to a server based network running MS 2000/2003/2008 Server (our existing vertical package software will support either), along with SQL Server 2000, 2005, or 2008.  <br>\n <br>\nIn that regard, what we'd like from you as part of your services is a recommendation of  new server hardware and software (from choices noted above) which we will independently acquire (you'll be welcome to seperately bid on that, too, if you do that) and the appropriate introduction, installation  and integration of the server into our network. Please note that our vertical software developer will migrate their software and related files to the new server, once it is properly installed.<br>\n <br>\n2. As noted, we run a web site and it is also installed on our currently main XP machine.  We want to make sure that IP settings are configured correctly with new server co so that it, runs properly.<br>\n <br>\n3. We want you to provide recommendations for appropriate security hardware and/or software.<br>\n <br>\n4. We currently have a network attached storage server, but not sure it is most effeciently configured (Netgear NV+ with 4 1TB drives).  We'd like you to review current configuration and help us make choices about the best setup (or required changes).<br>\n <br>\n5. Separately, we'll probably want to discuss an ongoing retainer for maintenance consulting.<br>\n <br>\nIf you have any questions in this regard, please advise. If you are still interested, please respond by Friday.

Being a part of our programming department means supporting our past solutions, contributing to current projects, and researching the latest and greatest to keep us abreast of technological waves. We're a small shop that accomplishes big things by always striving to work smarter rather than harder. Programming is key to our success! <br>\n<br>\nWho Are We Looking For? <br>\nWe're looking for honest and enthusiastic developers who are eager to learn--and teach--new things. We expect an incoming intern will have a solid, not necessarily deep, understanding of both front-end and back-end web development; semantic (X)HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby on Rails and MySQL are the primary tools we choose to use. Being comfortable in a text editor is a must--you'll get no Dreamweaver here! Our past work has revolved largely around FileMaker databases while we see our future shifting toward the Cappuccino JS framework. Experience in these technologies is a plus; being open to learning them is a must.<br>\n<br>\nWhat Do We Expect? <br>\nWe expect you to be as committed to us as we are to you. Both we and our clients are heavily invested in our projects, and if we bring you in as part of our crew, we expect serious commitment and a willingness to work as a team member. The internship is part-time for 12 weeks, 20 hours per week. We're flexible in how those hours get fulfilled in our 8:30AM--5PM, Monday--Friday business week. If you are currently enrolled in a college program for which your participation in the internship could earn you school credit, we are happy to oblige; just let us know during the application process and understand that your school requirements are separate from our requirements. <br>\n<br>\nWhat's In It For You? <br>\nThe internship is unpaid, though we care greatly about our interns' compensation. This isn't the kind of internship where you'll get stuck with boring, menial tasks; you will be developing systems around which people's jobs depend; you will be working on honest-to-goodness, live websites; you will be making a difference. At the end of it all, you will walk away with valuable experience and solid portfolio pieces. And all seriousness aside, we think we're a pretty fun group to work with.

We are mostly interested in a brief description of why your skills would match the job at hand.<br>\n<br>\nProject Overview:<br>\nOur small medical claim billing company currently submits Medicaid medical claims from medical providers to a State Medicaid program via EDI files.  The turnaround time on submitting claims and getting feedback on the payment status of these claims is currently at least 24 hours using the state's batch EDI upload/download system.<br>\n<br>\nThe State has recently developed a very user-unfriendly site based on DotNetNuke (an ASP.NET-based content management system) that has much quicker turnaround.  Our company has full access to this secure site, but it is painfully time-consuming to use manually.  It is a slow site with a terrible user interface.<br>\n<br>\nTo improve our customer service, we would like to allow our customers to continue using our site as they always have to enter their claim data.  However, on the back end we want to create an application that logs into the new state site (if a current logged in session does not exist), reads claim entry information from our database (provider, patient, service line information) and submits it via the site.  On a scheduled basis, this app would also log into the state site (if a current logged in session does not exist), retrieve the status of any pending claims, and update the database with this status information.  The app will also on a scheduled basis update our database with provider and patient data gathered from the site.<br>\n<br>\nThis project will require quite a fairly thorough reverse-engineering of the site to be scraped.  The site seems to rely heavily on cookies, so being able to analyze what navigation elements to expect or not expect based on current cookie values will be essential.  Also, an understanding of thread management will be important as we will probably need to manage multiple browser sessions to in order to process entries and queries more quickly than serial entry will allow.<br>\n<br>\nBe sure to read the instructions above for what to include in your response email!

Founded in 1997 in Laramie, Wyoming, Handel today has customers in over 40 states and supports thousands of users of its RiteTrack software platform.<br>\n<br>\nHandel sets itself apart from its competition through exceptional support, sophisticated technology, and most importantly, great people (both customers and employees). We employ some of the brightest, best-educated individuals from all over the country who have chosen Handel as the best place to develop their careers and Laramie as the best place to raise their families and to enjoy the Wyoming lifestyle to its fullest. During a recent survey we found that the average commute time for a Handel employee is around 10 minutes by bicycle, and under 5 minutes by car. However, with all the fiber-optics going through our state, sometimes we find that our employees can get all their work done directly from home.<br>\n<br>\nAnother thing that sets us apart is our work environment. At Handel we very much promote a work-hard, play-hard philosophy. Located in a historic building in old-town Laramie, our office environment reflects this philosophy both through resources available to our employees (fitness room, game room, break room, bar), benefits (home computer lease, broadband subsidy, fitness club subsidy, wellness program, just to mention a few), and activities (such as last Friday of the month lunches, summer family picnic, ski day, relays, Christmas party, etc.).<br>\n    <br>\nOur town is located in the southeast portion of the state of Wyoming in the scenic Laramie Valley, bordered by two mountain ranges. It is a wonderful place for outdoor enthusiasts and people who enjoy wide-open spaces, very little traffic or crowds, and a small college town environment.  Laramie has slightly less than 30,000 people and that includes the student body at the University of Wyoming. The town offers superb quality of life with a low crime rate and a relatively low cost of living. By the way, Wyoming has over 300 days of sunshine, is home to Yellowstone National Park, the Grand Tetons, the Black Hills and Devil's Tower. Wyoming is where the Great Plains meets the Rocky Mountains. It is also the sacred land of the Arapaho, Shoshone and Crow Indians.<br>\n<br>","url":"http://fortcollins.craigslist.org/sof/2588147820.html","title":"Senior Software Engineer"},{"email":"gigs-wysdm-2588144499@craigslist.org","posted_on":"2011/09/08 08:15:00 -0700","body":"I'm looking to have graphics printed on Blank DVDs for our reel.

You will be working with me and possibly one other developer on a highly interactive web application that will live in a LAMP environment.  We have a dedicated designer, so no graphics work is required.  This project will be more enjoyable than your standard website.  To be considered, you're going to need the following in your tool belt:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Object-oriented PHP 5</li>\n<li>MySQL - triggers, sprocs, views, knowledge of how to construct more than a basic query</li>\n<li>Object-oriented JavaScript using prototype and jQuery</li>\n<li>The ability to code without being reliant upon a framework.  You need to be okay without Zend, Cake, CI, Yii, etc.</li>\n<li>Obviously, you need to be up to snuff with your CSS and HTML.</li>\n<li>Located in or around Austin.  I'm in Temple, and we may occasionally need to meet.  There's a reason I am posting this in the Austin section - don't even think about being from out of the area.</li>\n<li>Don't have a toxic personality.  No whining/complaining/bitching.  We're a good group and we don't need anybody harshing the mellow.</li>\n<li>Be open to sharing knowledge - this goes both ways</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We are an established company with money, so you don't have to worry about any of that \"partnership\", \"profit sharing\" or \"work now, pay later\" BS.  You don't have to be a world-class dev (but I certainly won't turn you away if you are), but you can't be a green horn either.  You should have a few projects under your belt, and perhaps some formal education.</p>\n\n<p><b>If you're interested, send me a link to something you've done - ideally with some jQuery and AJAX</b>.  If you have a resume, feel free to send that as well, or just give me a brief explanation of your experience.  I'm really a lot more interested in seeing your code than your credentials.  The pay is 25/hr on a 1099 and you'll be signing an NDA before work starts.  If you're a troll that just surfs CL to respond to posters bitching about the rate, don't bother.

We'll be starting with weatherspark.com, which is a new type of weather website, showing in-depth weather information using graphs and maps. <br>\n<br>\nWe need a new logo, and a website & webapp redesign. The website is live on: <a href=\"http://weatherspark.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://weatherspark.com</a>, so you can check it out right now. <br>\n<br>\nThe site consists of two main components: a set of webpages with information (let's call that part the \"site\"), and then a flash application with the graphs and maps (let's call that part the \"app\", even though it's not a mobile app). <br>\n<br>\nYour first job will consist of creating: <br>\n<br>\n1. A unified and sensible color theme. There are *many* colors necessary to display all the information, and we want something that really works across the graphs, the map (& other parts of the app!), the site, and the logo.<br>\n<br>\n2. A better front page. The \"cool things\" section should presumably be more graphical, rather than several lines of plain text. Note that we want to be able to update these, and possibly show say 4 random things out of a list of 20. We're also intending to tie this into a combined help/feature exposure page ( <a href=\"http://weatherspark.com/features_and_help\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://weatherspark.com/features_and_help</a> ). Simplicity and tastefulness are the keywords. <br>\n<br>\n3. The app: we're considering skinning it by making the background a photo representing e.g. the current conditions (gmail has a skin in that general direction). Not set in stone. Vertical space is at a premium, so keep that in design-mind. We like the current containment hierarchy (header section w search box, map to the left, graphs to the right), so try to keep within that box. Also, do check out the other tabs as there's more than one page to the app. <br>\n<br>\n4. Logo. Currently the logo is effectively the name (\"WeatherSpark\"), though the favicon is a blue shield with a lightning bolt in it. The site is obviously weather related, so something that evokes weather, otherwise pretty free reins here. We're fine having the logo remain just the name. <br>\n<br>\n5. Design of the content pages for the site, and the blog. Should go with the rest of the theme of course, but otherwise no specific requirements. <br>\n<br>\n6. Sensible font choices. The current fonts were picked somewhat haphazardly, we'd be looking for a theme were the fonts used across the app & site work well together. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThe ideal candidate has a strong sense of color usage, information structure & presentation, and an obsessive attention to detail. Having designed infographics is a plus. <br>\n<br>\nYou can be anywhere in the world you like, but we're in California and you will need to be available for phone/skype during some time of a regular 9am-5pm business day. Most communication will be written, but especially for agreeing on the initial direction and review of drafts/final deliverable voice communication can greatly simplify things. <br>\n<br>\nWe like to work iteratively, and like to see rough sketches very early to avoid chasing down the wrong rabbit holes. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nTo apply, please reply by email with: <br>\n<br>\n1. Something that tells me you've actually read and understood the job description above (sorry, this is craigslist). <br>\n<br>\n2. At least 1 and most 3 links to the specific entries in your online portfolio you feel are applicable to the tasks outlined above. If nothing in your portfolio fits the bill then a sketch of a front-page suggestion + color palette will do wonders. By sketch I do mean sketch - an annotated wireframe with some font references is totally fine. <br>\n<br>\n3. A brief background on yourself and your design interests. This can be as simple as a short list of design-related books/blogs you've actually read that you feel are relevant to your field. We're looking for someone who cares deeply about design, colors, and layout, so you've probably taken classes or otherwise read up on things like color theory, how to use white space for effective communication and such. <br>\n<br>\n4. Your compensation requirements. We're looking much more for the right person than for the \"right\" price, but please be reasonable. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nThis is a part time contractor/freelance gig and you will need to provide your own work space, equipment, and software. You will be paid on either an hourly or project-basis, whichever we eventually agree upon, and you will need to invoice us for your fees. <br>\n<br>\nJacob, weatherspark.com<br>","url":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/web/2587384893.html","title":"Web/Color/Logo/Info Designer Wanted"},{"email":"gigs-cwzvz-2587381433@craigslist.org","posted_on":"2011/09/07 16:39:00 -0700","body":"Office help  web design  construction estimator.

Our team consists of two VC's and one PHD student. We will be well-financed and have a firm grasp of our future course, as well as a number of potential major institutional partners lined up. We do not want to get into too much detail regarding the content and direction of the site, but please contact us for further details. <br>\n<br>\nWe are looking for a bright, young ROCKSTAR programmer to partner with us as a Chief Tech Officer with an equity stake in the company. We do not wish to simply commission a programmer to build a beta site as we want our chief programmer to have a hand in the direction of the company. We are only looking for highly-skilled programmers in the New York area that have a strong desire to help adapt the antiquated method of Scientific Development for the better and wish to stamp their name on a revolutionary project. We anticipate a beta-version of the site to take 2-3 months to complete as much of the data and programs we wish to have encoded on the site are open-source. The site will require various implementations such as a pdf-reader, various searching functionalities, and an iTunes-esque Library set-up, among other things.<br>\n<br>\nWe are willing to barter with regards to compensation outside of equity, as your time would be equally valuable to us as it is to you. Time and place of work can be negotiated as well, but we foresee this being a full-time position that will require frequent face-time and discussion with the fellow management.<br>\n<br>\nOnly highly-skilled, excited candidates will be considered. We need an A+ programmer who can lay down a clean foundation to our site that won't require fixing in the long haul, and we are willing to pay what it takes. If you or someone you know is looking to be the next Zuckerberg, what better way to get a head-start than by partnering with a couple VCs and a PHD on a pre-financed, fully developed business plan?<br>\n<br>\nPlease email me with a brief description of who you are, where you studied (or study), what you have done, and how you could help our revolution.

Objective is to support marketing tasks, looking for companies in defined fields, with history, financial background, intellectual property filings, names of and [access path to] specified leadership people, etc. Typical task involves 5-10 hours of online work. Payment is usually by paypal, and we can do cash or mail checks. Some of our work requires signing an NDA, or even a background check. Everything we do is totally on top of the table - nothing is secret, unethical, illegal, etc. but the fact that we've done it is confidential.<br>\n<br>\nSome assignments are simply fact-checking, validating assumptions asserted in business plans, credentials in resumes, achievements listed by companies in their proposals, etc.<br>\n<br>\nSome assignments cannot be completed online, and may require some telephone calls, but this is not a sales or tele-anything project. In one case, an extraordinarily enterprising datasearcher drove to a company, and at 5pm stood in the parking lot with a clipboard in hand, asking questions of people as they left the building. It was not at our request or part of the job description, but the result was highly profitable and a bonus was paid. Since then we've specifically told our datasearchers not to do such things, but it's mentioned here so you'll get a more complete picture of what's going on.<br>\n<br>\nThe first project (or perhaps two) for any datasearcher is always assigned to a second person as well. Once performance has been demonstrated, a datasearcher goes solo and earns more per hour.<br>\n<br>\nReports should be succinct, limited to a list of facts with brief substantiation and source list. Accuracy counts, and the datasearcher need never generate conclusions. We obviously pay more for analysis - that might come later, so there's some growth potential. <br>\n<br>\nFiction will instantly disqualify and there will never be a second chance. We generally know about how long a given task should take, and as long as your reported hours fall within our expectations we won't question your request for payment.<br>\n<br>\nWe will provide password entry to databases to which we have subscriptions, but they can be used only for our projects unless we provide permission to use those databases for personal reasons.<br>\n<br>\nIf this seems interesting, send us a mini-resume. No inflation. Assume that one of our datasearchers will do fact-checking.

We don't want to waste time teaching you version control, how to use an IDE, or finish tasks you failed.  There is a big gap in someone who \"works with Drupal\" and a \"professional\".  We work on big projects, write custom code, and can't simply download a module to finish a job.  We are looking for someone to build an on going relationship, with on going work, from good quality honest people.  Let us know if your interested and we can setup a time to talk further.

Specifically we need to build a human model and rendering with different configurations of clothing such as changing the cut of the model's shirt, changing the colour or pattern, collar shape, etc.  There are really two people that we need:<br>\n<br>\n1. 3D modelling specialist that can build a realistic model of  a shirt, and compose a nice scene for it in Blender.  We also need a model of a person but this can be generic such as a Make Human stock model.  The clothing must be built to adjust to the Make Human model's body.  i.e. if the body is fattened, the shirt should adjust accordingly.<br>\n<br>\n2. Programmer who can automate the rendering of all the different human model and clothing possibilities.  So this would include pulling a variety of human models from Make Human with different body types, improting them into blender, swapping colours and materials of the 3D models in the scene, swapping different 3D models in and out of the scene, rendering the scene from multiple viewpoints and finally saving all the rendered images in a raster format like PNG.  Thre will probably be millions of images generated so EVERYTHING must be done programmatically and be fully automated.  We would also require the script to be built in an intuitive way so that we can update it later with new 3D models, colours or textures on the 3D models without having to dig through the whole mess of code.<br>\n<br>\nIf you think you have the skills to do one or both of the above jobs then please respond to this ad with either a portfolio of your 3d modelling work, or a brief summary of your Blender / Make Human programming experience.

He should be able to fill in the forms and print them.<br>\nFirst macro:  I have several forms which will require the input by the end user of a \"name\" and \"date\" and/or  \"state\".  I would like a macro for each which will put a \"insert name\" or whatever into the space on the form template.  When this is checked and the person types his name, the \"insert name\" will disappear.  <br>\nSecond macro, I would like to insert a comment at the same time.  Thus, when I put in the \"insert name\" there will be a comment box off to the right which will say for example, insert your full legal name, etc.  <br>\nThird macro:  Some of the forms may have a choice between two paragraphs in the form.  The user will check one of the boxes representing his choice.  The paragraph he choses will remain.  At the same time, the unchecked boxes and their corresponding paragraphs will disappear and the form will be one continuous form.  <br>\nFourth macro:  Some forms require setting forth the State. This is generally at the top of the form.   Therefore need a drop down menu to select the \"state\" from.  <br>\nFifth macro:  Depending on which state is selected, (from above if possible) a paragraph (from another document) will be inserted into the form, at the end of the form, corresponding to that particular state's requirements.  <br>\nSixth macro:  After the form is filled in, need a box with a question asking if all the information such as name, State, date, etc are filled in to their satisfaction and they are ready to print the form.  If so, then be able to print the form without the comments.  This can be by a macro eliminating the comments or anyway that is feasible.  <br>\n<br>","url":"http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sby/cpg/2586035046.html","title":"Macros VB for Word 2010"},{"email":"gigs-g8d7z-2586030533@craigslist.org","posted_on":"2011/09/07 00:20:00 -0700","body":"Hiring a part-time software engineer for a machine learning research project. <br>\n <br>\nResponsibilities:<br>\n1.

I literally used it once printing a black and white 2 page resume and then this.  HELP!  Willing to pay $15, can bring it to you or you come here.  Should be easy $$ for someone who knows how to fix this and wants to get paid upon successful fix.  Reply via email or call 515-988-8278, I will get back to you same day.

We need assistance in supporting and adding new modules to an internal (and mature) Software as a Service app that we maintain.

Occasional graphic design contributions are also welcome if you have that skill, but are not required.</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Role #2: Client Contract Development</b><br>\nWe provide software development for a number of customers around the Atlanta area and beyond. If you are in the Atlanta area and possess the skills listed below, send us your resume and we can quickly staff you on one of these projects.

Most of our projects involve straight <b>PHP/JQuery/MySQL</b> work, but we occasionally take on other projects that could involve anything from Ruby on Rails to .NET to Visual Basic. We also get occasional Front End Development work that involves wireframe markup, hand-coded html, CSS, client side scripting and UI effects.\n<br><br>\nThe key here is versatility. We like a resource that isn't pigeon-holed into one discipline over another. We also like someone who is flexible and can comfortably move from project to project. If you're intelligent, easy-going, well-rounded, and hard-working, we can probably put you to work!\n<br><br>\nSome of our projects allow remote work, so communication is critical. We communicate extensively through tools like IM, audio chat, and phone. It's critical that you be a self-starter and self-motivated. Our projects do not typically involve someone staring over your shoulder, but we place high expectations on resources to deliver results in a timely manner.\n<br><br>\n<font color=\"red\">Please do not contact us if you are a recruiter or have a \"team\" you are trying to staff.

We are a start up building a social publishing site based on Wordpress CMS and the Buddypress plugin. We would like to customise the theme and plug in as well as make some changes to the CMS to adapt it to serve our needs. Primarily we are looking at having the following functionailties:<br>\n<br>\n1. A CMS that allows users to post URLs (like bookmarks )into various categories of interest. Think examples like Delicious, Digg etc (without the voting element) . WP typically is oriented towards blogging as opposed to social publishing. But we love the social networking feature provided by Buddypress , hence we wish to go with Wordpress . This will mean you will have to edit the WP PHP code to allow bookmarking or simply collecting URLs as opposed to full length articles.<br>\n2. Edit the stylesheet to develop a new theme/style i.e place all the available features in WP+BP in a new layout that is minimal and quick to load.<br>\n3. Design the logo and associated slogan.<br>\n4. Help install everything in a hosting account that we will purchase.<br>\n<br>\nWe believe most of the core functionailty is already available with WP+Buddypress but a certain amount of customisation will help us get to what we are envisioning.  As such we do not estimate this work to run into the thousands. So if you are averse to taking up smaller projects , this may not be up your alley. However if the work is satisfactory, we may have ongoing projects.<br>\n<br>\nPlease send us your contact details, portfolio etc. You need to have prior experience /familiarity working with Wordpress and Buddypress.

The creation of a community is essential. This community will open the site up to a network of registered users who will be able to interact with each other.
